## Overview
This code defines functions for converting feet to meters. It then demonstrates the usage of these functions by converting some sample values and printing the results.

A real-world unit converter might encompass a wider range of units and more sophisticated conversion functions. The implementation might also involve error handling, input validation, and a user-friendly interface for input and output.

This is a basic representation to showcase the logic behind unit conversion in Python. In a complete project or program, there might be more functionalities, possibly implemented using classes, additional units, or error handling to enhance the converter's reliability and usability.
